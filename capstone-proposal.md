## Name of Project: 

*Unity Game (No title yet!)

## Project's Purpose or Goal: 

* This project will be an interactive Unity-engine based game where a player can move through a level, engage with enemies NPCs, interact with objects and terrain, and reach a goal to complete the game.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Working project build
* Movable character
* Enemies characters
* Interaction between the environment (objects and enemies) and player
* Goal (reach endpoint of level)

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, apis, modules, and other resources will you use to create this MVP?

The Unity engine with many of its built in libraries including cinemachine.

## If you finish developing the MVP with time to spare what will you work on next?

* Add SFX and background music
* Add Title Screen
* Add Pause Menu
* Equippable items/weapons
* More quest-oriented gameplay 
* Explore shader graphs for more visual effects

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

* I'm excited to explore the Unity Engine some more and dive into some deeper features like camera control and a flexible system for creating levels with prescribed pieces.
